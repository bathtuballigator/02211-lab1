To verify our solutions run src/run_test.sh script.

In Part 2: CHP simulation we have created 3 channels - one inert, one remove and one instruction channel.
Instruction channel is used to determine which action (insert or remove) we are executing.
Remove takes the first number for the queue and shifts the other numbers stored in the buffer forward, towards the top of the queue.
Insert puts the first number at the top of the queue. Whenever a new number is inserted - we iterate through the queue checking if the number is smaller than the numbers inserted.
When we encounter an already inserted number that's larger than a new number - we insert the new number in it's place and propagate the old number further down the queue.
